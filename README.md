# PasswordStrengthPrediction
Password Strength Prediction with NLP and Logistic Regression
This project focuses on predicting the strength of passwords using machine learning techniques, specifically leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and Logistic Regression. The goal is to evaluate passwords and categorize them into different strength levels—Weak, Moderate, and Strong—based on various features derived from the password text.

Key Components:

Data Processing:

TF-IDF Vectorization: Textual passwords are converted into numerical feature vectors using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization. This technique helps in capturing the importance of each character or word within the password relative to its frequency in the dataset.
Additional Features: Apart from TF-IDF features, additional numerical features such as password length and the frequency of lowercase letters are computed. These features provide further insights into the complexity and characteristics of the passwords.
Model Training:

A Logistic Regression classifier is used to model the relationship between the extracted features and the password strength categories. The model is trained on a labeled dataset where passwords are annotated with their respective strength levels.
The inclusion of both text-derived features and manually calculated features ensures a comprehensive representation of each password, improving the model’s predictive performance.
Evaluation and Prediction:

The trained model is evaluated using various metrics to ensure its accuracy and reliability.
The model can be used to predict the strength of new passwords, providing users with feedback on the robustness of their passwords and suggesting improvements.
This project demonstrates the effective application of NLP techniques in cybersecurity and provides a practical tool for assessing password strength. It highlights the importance of integrating both text-based features and additional attributes to enhance the performance of machine learning models in security applications.
